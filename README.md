# Template Repository for Cross-Platform Development of Mobile Applications

Dear all!

Please use this project as a template for your own projects. At any time but for sure until the deadline all project artefacts must be added or linked to this project.

There are no restrictions for the structure of your project. The only requirements are, that this README.md contains links to all your project artefacts and that documents are living in `documents/`.

All the best

# Project-Name

Description: This is a short description on what your project is about. Goals/ target users. As soon as it is available ONE representative screenshot.

## Technology

Brief description (perhaps bulletpoints) on the used technology stack.

## Team Setup

Bulletpoint list of team members (if you fly the web in stealth mode of course anonymized). As the project moves on the list should give a coarse grained overview on who was responsible for what.
